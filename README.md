# ASC UNIT TEST

## Resources

- [Chai reference](https://www.chaijs.com/api/bdd/)
- Need to `require` function in test case file
- Don't forget to to do `npm install`
- Make sure to update `package.json` script if you change the test case's file name
- Start with basic checks using `expect`, then you can work on random.
- Try to keep format of titles consistent
- First test is usually checking that the function exists
- Only 10 tests per challenge
- Last 2 tests should be randomized tests
- Check other sample test cases I sent for reference
- I'll try to get a test challenge zone up and running so you can try uploading challenges to the site
